Planetary Habitat Optimization System
MongoDB Database: Set up a MongoDB database to store essential data related to the planetary habitat, such as environmental conditions, soil composition, atmospheric composition, and plant growth data.
Web Application Frontend: Design a web application frontend that allows users to interact with the Planetary Habitat Optimization System. Users can input parameters like planet characteristics and environmental constraints.
OpenCV for Image Processing: Utilize OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) to analyze and process images from the target planet's surface or environment. This could involve image analysis of terrain, soil samples, and atmospheric conditions to gather crucial data.

Machine Learning for Habitat Optimization: Implement Machine Learning algorithms to optimize the planetary habitat based on the gathered data. The ML models can assist in selecting the most suitable crops, adjusting environmental parameters, and predicting plant growth in the alien environment.

Planetary Simulation: Create a realistic simulation environment that emulates the target planet's conditions, including temperature, atmospheric pressure, radiation levels, and gravity. This simulation will allow the system to test and optimize the habitat parameters in a controlled environment.

Life Support System: Integrate a life support system that can monitor and control various environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, air composition, and radiation levels, to ensure the survival and growth of plants.

Visualizations and Recommendations: Provide visualizations and recommendations to users through the web application, showcasing the optimal habitat design and the potential for supporting life on the target planet.

Sustainability Analysis: Implement sustainability analysis, where the system evaluates the long-term feasibility of the habitat design, considering factors like resource utilization, waste management, and energy efficiency.
